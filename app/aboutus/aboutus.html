Educational institutions are the true seats of learning. The students, who are really anxious to learn, can develop healthy habits only in the schools. In a school we are taught how to move in society, how to behave with others and how to progress in life. 
I read in the Somya Public Charter School - Delhi. With a lush garden outside, the school building presents a magnificent view. Its grassy lawns and gravel path with flowers along its sides and the Asoka trees growing near the gate add to its beauty. Any outsider may form the idea that it is perhaps a memorial building.
